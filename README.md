# Robotic-arm-trained-using-reinforcement-learning
Recognizing the limitations of pre-programmed systems commonly used in robotic arms, this research introduces a robotic arm based on deep reinforcement learning, and designs a path planning method that combines the Desired State Reward Guidance (DSRG) algorithm with the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
